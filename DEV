I need a way to keep this file synced.
This would either involve:
  SystemD
  Cron
  An entry in ~/.bashrc that would run every time bash starts
 
Since I need it to work on MacOS as well, which doesn't have SystemD, or cron, the .bashrc entry sounds like a good starting point.
I'd need it to do something like this:

(
    LATEST_VERSION=$(curl -s "https://api.github.com/repos/tal-zvon/vimrc/commits?path=vimrc&page=1&per_page=1" | grep '^[ ]\{4\}"sha"' | cut -d '"' -f 4)
    CURRENT_VERSION=$(...)

    if [[ "$LATEST_VERSION" != "$CURRENT_VERSION" ]]
    then
        ...
        echo "vimrc updated"
    fi
) & disown

The disown is so that bash doesn't report that the task is done when it completes.
The background process is so that it doesn't slow down bash from opening.
There are 2 problems:
  1. Printing with echo from a background process isn't ideal. Maybe I can use wall.
  2. My vimrc install script requires sudo. I can't run a subprocess with sudo. Maybe instead of doing the full install, I should just make it sync the vimrc file, and nothing else
