My .vimrc file

Automatically installs Vim-Plug, and any plugins I need before configuring
them.

Install:

    sudo bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tal-zvon/vimrc/master/install.sh)"
    
Optional Args:

    Add --with-rust to install support for Rust. This may not work on older distributions, like Raspbian, or CentOS because their nvim version is too old.

Shortcuts:

    \m - Enable/Disable mouse
    \n - Enable/Disable NERDTree
    \t - Enable/Disable Tagbar
    \c - Enable/Disable Copy Mode
        Makes it easy to copy lines

        Hides line numbers, NERDTree, Tagbar, Git Gutter, and disables
        Mouse
    \a - Make vimdiff ignore CachedBmp files (for Adobe Animate)
    Ctrl+n - Next buffer
    Ctrl+p - Previous buffer
    \w - Enable-disable whitespace highlighting
        Tabs, and trailing spaces
